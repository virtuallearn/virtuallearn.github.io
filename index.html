			<h2 id="Schottky">Schottky diodes</h2>
				<p>Schottky diodes are constructed of a metal-to-N junction rather than a P-N 
				semiconductor junction. Also known as hot-carrier diodes, Schottky diodes are 
				characterized by fast switching times (low reverse-recovery time), low forward 
				voltage drop (typically 0.25 to 0.4 volts for a metal-silicon junction), and low 
				junction capacitance.</p>
				<p>The schematic symbol for a Schottky diode is shown in the figure below.</p>
				<img src="files/img/schottky-diode.webp" alt="TM">
				<p class="figcaption">Fig. Schottky diode schematic symbol.</p>
				<h3 class="subheading">Advantages and Disadvantages of Schottky Diodes</h3>
					<p>The forward voltage drop ' VF ', reverse-recovery time ' trr ', and junction 
					capacitance ' CJ ' of Schottky diodes are closer to ideal than the average “rectifying” 
					diode. This makes them well suited for high-frequency applications. Unfortunately, 
					though, Schottky diodes typically have lower forward current (IF) and reverse 
					voltage (VRRM and VDC) ratings than rectifying diodes and are thus unsuitable for 
					applications involving substantial amounts of power. Though they are used in low 
					voltage switching regulator power supplies.</p>
			<h2 id="Tunnel">Tunnel diodes</h2>
				<p>Tunnel diodes exploit a strange quantum phenomenon called resonant tunneling to 
				provide a negative resistance forward-bias characteristics. When a small forward-bias 
				voltage is applied across a tunnel diode, it begins to conduct current. (Figure below(b)) 
				As the voltage is increased, the current increases and reaches a peak value called the 
				peak current (IP). If the voltage is increased a little more, the current actually begins 
				to decrease until it reaches a low point called the valley current (IV). If the voltage 
				is increased further yet, the current begins to increase again, this time without 
				decreasing into another “valley.” The schematic symbol for the tunnel diode shown in figure(a) below.</p>
				<img class="maximg" src="files/img/tunnel-diodes.webp" alt="TM" />
				<p class="files/figcaption">Fig. Tunnel diode (a) Schematic symbol. (b) Current vs voltage plot (c) Oscillator.</p>
				<p>The forward voltages necessary to drive a tunnel diode to its peak and valley currents are known as peak 
				voltage (VP) and valley voltage (VV), respectively. The region on the graph where current is decreasing while 
				applied voltage is increasing (between VP and VV on the horizontal scale) is known as the region of negative resistance.</p>
				<p>Tunnel diodes, also known as Esaki diodes in honor of their Japanese inventor Leo Esaki, are able to 
				transition between peak and valley current levels very quickly, “switching” between high and low states of 
				conduction much faster than even Schottky diodes. Tunnel diode characteristics are also relatively unaffected 
				by changes in temperature.</p>

				<h3 class="subheading">Characteristics of Tunnel Diodes</h3>
					<p>Tunnel diodes are heavily doped in both the P and N regions, 1000 times the level in a rectifier. 
					This can be seen in the figure above. Standard diodes are to the far left, zener diodes near to the 
					left, and tunnel diodes to the right of the dashed line. The heavy doping produces an unusually thin 
					depletion region. This produces an unusually low reverse breakdown voltage with high leakage. The 
					thin depletion region causes high capacitance. To overcome this, the tunnel diode junction area must be tiny.</p>
					<p>The forward diode characteristic consists of two regions: a normal forward diode characteristic 
					with current rising exponentially beyond VF, 0.3 V for Ge, 0.7 V for Si.</p>
					<p>Between 0 V and VF is an additional “negative resistance” characteristic peak. This is due 
					to quantum mechanical tunneling involving the dual particle-wave nature of electrons. The 
					depletion region is thin enough compared with the equivalent wavelength of the electron 
					that they can tunnel through. They do not have to overcome the normal forward diode 
					voltage VF. The energy level of the conduction band of the N-type material overlaps 
					the level of the valence band in the P-type region. With increasing voltage, tunneling begins; 
					the levels overlap; current increases, up to a point. As current increases further, the energy 
					levels overlap less; current decreases with increasing voltage. This is the “negative resistance” 
					portion of the curve.</p>
				<h3 class="subheading">Applications of Tunnel Diodes</h3>
					<p>Tunnel diodes are not good rectifiers, as they have relatively high “leakage” current 
					when reverse-biased. Consequently, they find application only in special circuits where 
					their unique tunnel effect has value. To exploit the tunnel effect, these diodes are 
					maintained at a bias voltage somewhere between the peak and valley voltage levels, always 
					in a forward-biased polarity (anode positive, and cathode negative).</p>
					<p>Perhaps the most common application of a tunnel diode is in simple high-frequency 
					oscillator circuits as in the figure(c) above, where it allows a DC voltage source to 
					contribute power to an LC “tank” circuit, the diode conducting when the voltage across 
					it reaches the peak (tunnel) level and effectively insulating at all other voltages. 
					The resistors bias the tunnel diode at a few tenths of a volt centered on the negative 
					resistance portion of the characteristic curve. The L-C resonant circuit may be a section 
					of a waveguide for microwave operation. Oscillation to 5 GHz is possible.</p>
				<h3 class="subheading">History of Tunnel Diodes</h3>
					<p>At one time the tunnel diode was the only solid-state microwave amplifier available. 
					Tunnel diodes were popular starting in the 1960’s. They were longer lived than traveling 
					wave tube amplifiers, an important consideration in satellite transmitters. Tunnel diodes 
					are also resistant to radiation because of the heavy doping.</p>
					<p>Today various transistors operate at microwave frequencies. Even small signal tunnel 
					diodes are expensive and difficult to find today. There is one remaining manufacturer 
					of germanium tunnel diodes, and none for silicon devices. They are sometimes used in military 
					equipment because they are insensitive to radiation and large temperature changes.</p>
					<p>There has been some research involving the possible integration of silicon tunnel diodes 
					into CMOS integrated circuits. They are thought to be capable of switching at 100 GHz in digital 
					circuits. The sole manufacturer of germanium devices produces them one at a time. A batch process 
					for silicon tunnel diodes must be developed, then integrated with conventional CMOS processes. [SZL]</p>
					<p>The Esaki tunnel diode should not be confused with the resonant tunneling diode CH 2, of more 
					complex construction from compound semiconductors. The RTD is a more recent development capable of 
					higher speed.</p>
